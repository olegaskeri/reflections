What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When I initialize a repository, git creates a hidden directory in the repository called .git. That hidden directory contains meta-data describing the state of the files in the repository. I need to do it to be able to track changes to the files in the repository.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is different from both repository and the working directory in that it is a sort of preliminary and temporary area. It separates those files we are going to commit from the rest of the files in the working directory. The value it offers is just that: to separate the files being prepared for a commit in order to enable us to review the changes before we finally commit them.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	By having a possibility to revisit my changes within the staging area before I commit them I am better prepared to make weighted decisions on what to commit as a separate stage in the project development process. If in doubt, I can use git diff command to compare the staging area contents with the working directory and make sure the changes I am about to commit indeed represent a separate logical stage in the development of the project.
