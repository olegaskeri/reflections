What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When I initialize a repository, git creates a hidden directory in the repository called .git. That hidden directory contains meta-data describing the state of the files in the repository. I need to do it to be able to track changes to the files in the repository.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is different from both repository and the working directory in that it is a sort of preliminary and temporary area. It separates those files we are going to commit from the rest of the files in the working directory. The value it offers is just that: to separate the files being prepared for a commit in order to enable us to review the changes before we finally commit them.
